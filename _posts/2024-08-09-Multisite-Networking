### The Problem

One of the hardest problems when learning Cybersecurity is finding the right place to train. While some might resort to Virtual Machines on their computers, others might look to solutions in public cloud. For our Collegiate Cybersecurity Defense Competition (CCDC) Team, we built our own solution.

### The Approach

What was truly needed for our idea to work was geographically distributing a set of servers while having the network services accessible from anywhere. Typically, this requires something known as a site-to-site virtual private network (S2S VPN). 

One might ask, "Why not connect every single computer into the VPN network?"

The reason is two-fold: 
1) Configuration time would be exponential
2) Having a dedicated Layer-3 virtual routing device allows us to create our own virtual LANs, creating a more secure and segmented network overall.

### Multisite Networking

For our setup, we used [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) for our VPN. Tailscale is a centralized VPN service, meaning that all traffic will flow through their servers before hitting our own. However, the traffic is end-to-end encrypted and you don't need to be connected to the VPN to see if your devices are connected to the Tailscale network. 

For our servers, we utilized several pre-owned Dell servers from [SaveMyServer](https://savemyserver.com/). Once recieved, we flashed [Proxmox Virtualization Environment](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-virtual-environment/overview) on all servers for a readily accessible user interface.
